This is an integrated evaluation technical project designed to test students’ abilities to adapt to changing scenarios and difficult and complex requirements. It builds on a case study designed by a design team
during the course of the System’s Analysis and Design block of the BInfHons programme.

In this project, groups are expected to adapt and implement the provided wireframes and class diagram prepared by other students as part of the SA&D block.

This block places focus on the Dart programming language and the Flutter UI Framework, and as such,groups are expected to develop a mobile application that implements the provided design. To do this,
each group will be required to adapt the design to fit the constraints of developing user interfaces in Flutter. Further adaptations may also be required due to time constraints, modelling inaccuracies (note that these
designs are student generated), as well as the relative development strengths of the group providing the implementation. 

These adaptations are permitted and expected.

Project Requirements

Students should start by adapting the provided design, without necessarily modelling the application afresh.
No submission is required for the adaptation, but some grades are awarded for how well the adaption is performed.

Thereafter, students should implement a prototype of a mobile application conforming to their new design and fulfilling the spirit of the original proposal and design. This prototype should be implemented - on the frontend - using the Dart programming language and the Flutter UI Framework. The backend of the system
should be one of the group’s choosing. Each application should also integrate with at least one Calendar API, again of the group’s choosing.
